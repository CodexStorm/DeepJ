# DeepJ
The findings of two models, "EnhancerMithocondhriaEM2D" and "MithocondhriaEMSegmentation2D" are compared. We begin by opening a test picture and running "DeepImageJ Run" with the first model. We save the segmented result as a tiff file after extracting the first channel of the image. We repeat the procedure, but this time we utilize the second model to generate the result. Once we get the result, we use DeepImageJ Validate to examine the variance. 

We validate the result primarly using two measures. The Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) is used to calculate the difference between the source and segmented images; the lower the RMSE value, the better the segmentation performance. The value for the test photos we used in the procedure was 0.413. The Mean Accuracy error(MAE) refers to the similarity of measurements to their "real" values. The greater the deviation from a measurement's expected or real value, the less accurate it is. The test images had a value of 0.205.
